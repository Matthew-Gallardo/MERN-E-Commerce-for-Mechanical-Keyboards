Frontend - In the frontend side, I used React as the frontend library. I used Redux for state management. Lastly I use React styled components library for basic designing of the interface.

Backend - For the backend side, I used the Express library on top of Nodejs. I also use MongoDB as the database to store my data . I create REST APIs with Express and use these endpoints in the React frontend to interact with my backend part.

For the payment - I used stripe api sandbox for credit cards etc.

Postman- add, update , delete data
